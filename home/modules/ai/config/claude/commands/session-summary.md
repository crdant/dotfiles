- Note any performance metrics (response times, token usage, etc.)

## Step 3: Efficiency Analysis
- Analyze the efficiency of our interactions during this session
- Identify what worked well and what could be streamlined
- Rate the overall session effectiveness on a scale of 1-10 with justification
